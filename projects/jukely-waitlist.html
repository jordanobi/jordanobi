      <h3>Company</h3>
      <p>Jukely</p>
      <h3>Role</h3>
      <p>Product Designer</p>
      <h3>Project</h3>
      <p>In early 2016, Jukely’s concert subscription service was experiencing high churn rates. Customer exit surveys said that users were canceling their subscriptions because shows they wanted to see were selling out too often and too quickly. At the same time, Jukely’s booking team was having difficulty approximating user demand for shows on the platform, leading to over and under booking. </p>

  <p>Standby is a feature we built that lets Jukely members get on a waitlist for a sold out show. Capturing this signal of interest and intent enabled the team to optimize utilization of spots across the entire system by allowing us to maintain a queue of users for each show who were ready to fill open spots when other users decided they could no longer attend. </p>

<p>On the back end, the feature also provided a way for the booking team to better forecast demand for shows and be more cost effective in their negotiations with venues for tickets. Within a week of the feature’s release, 70% of users had used the feature and after a month we saw churn rates fall in some cities by as much as 40%. </p> <p>The product was featured in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/10/jukely-adds-a-standby-list/">TechCrunch</a>, <a href="https://www.manhattandigest.com/2016/03/10/jukely-standby-feature-helps-get-you-into-sold-out-nyc-concerts/">Manhattan Digest</a> and <a href="http://www.dancingastronaut.com/2016/03/jukely-adds-long-awaited-standby-feature/">Dancing Astronaut</a>.</p>
