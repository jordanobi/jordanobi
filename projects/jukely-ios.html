      <h1>Jukely iOS</h1>
      <h3>Company</h3>
      <p>Jukely</p>
      <h3>Role</h3>
      <p>Product Designer</p>
      <h3>Project</h3>
    <p>  During the winter of 2014, Jukely went through a major product and
      business evolution. For years the company had been focused on
      building a free concert notification and discovery app, but that
      winter the team launched the first version of an entirely new paid
      product - a concert subscription service called Jukely Unlimited. </p>

<p>This new service, sandwiched into the existing product, gave subscribers
  access to an unlimited number of concerts from a curated list of
  shows happening in their city every month. Explosive new user growth
  drove the company to pivot to focusing on the feature almost exclusively.
  Unfortunately, poor product IA/navigation, a mountain of tech/design
  debt and a muddled brand and product narrative were hurting conversion of free
  users to paid subscribers. </p>

<p>As one of Jukely’s first product designers, I helped lead a focused redesigned of
  the iOS experience from concept to launch. My contributions involved high-level
  product strategy, ideation, rapid-prototyping, interaction design, qualitative and
   quantitative testing, visual design, product writing and software development in Swift.
   In December 2015 it was featured in Apple's Best New Apps.</p>
   <h3>Team</h3>
      <p>Chris (Creative Director), Jay (Brand Designer), Dan (ENG)</p>
      <h3>Customer Goals + Business KPI</h3>
